            Added Optional Keyboard Controls! You can now steer the skier with the A and D keys respectively...F still gives you a speed boost, and Tilting still controls your speed...and I gotta say, sorry I didn't implement this sooner, it's awesome!

            Moved the options to a separate screen. This cleans up the start screen a bit, and overall makes things a little prettier.

            Made some performance improvements when using Tilt controls. Please Note: When using Tilt controls on a non 1.4.1 version of WebOS, you may still experience some performance issues. This is a bug in the OS, and is fixed in version 1.4.1.
